dsixda's Android Kitchen

Compatible with Windows (Cygwin) / Linux / Mac OS X


Who is this kitchen for?
Those who are brand new to creating custom ROMs and want an easy place to start learning
Those who just want to modify shipped ROMs or someone else's custom ROMs to their liking
Those who are confused by all those scripts and complex commands required for building and extracting

Please note:
The kitchen will not automatically turn you into a developer. A developer is someone who writes code or builds something from the ground up and understands exactly what goes on behind the scenes. The kitchen hides all that and puts a user-friendly interface above it. However, this may be the push that gets you into development in the future.
My goal is to give you the tools to make your life easier and save you lots of time, and at the same time help you learn about the Android OS.
A little bit of prior UNIX command-line knowledge would be useful to get started with the kitchen, but the help guides should be enough for a newbie. Knowledge of command lines is always important if you ever want to get involved in Android or development.
